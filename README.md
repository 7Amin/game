n order to import ROMS, you need to download Roms.rar from the Atari 2600 VCS ROM Collection and extract the .rar file. Once you've done that, run:

python -m atari_py.import_roms <path to folder>

This should print out the names of ROMs as it imports them. The ROMs will be copied to your atari_py installation directory.
